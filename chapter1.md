# Executive Summary

The purpose of this automated test was to confirm whether the target web application meets the most basic

security requirements. The test was meant to simulate a malicious attacker exploiting common

vulnerabilities and breaches in a web application. The attacks were conducted under the level of access

and privilege that a general Internet user would have.
