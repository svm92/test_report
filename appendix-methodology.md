# Appendix: Methodology

It should be noted that this test was performed in an automated manner using tools such as Arachni or

OWASP ZAP, with no direct human intervention. This makes the test non-exhaustive, and it should be assumed

that the target web application has many more vulnerabilities and security breaches than the ones

mentioned in this report. This test should be taken as a 'lower floor' for possible vulnerabilities. If

this automated test is able to find vulnerabilities in a web application, a resourceful human should be

able to find many more, most of which would escape the scope of this test. If the tested web application

is found to be vulnerable, it is recommended to contact a professional penetration tester to find and

mitigate these and other security breaches.
